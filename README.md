# QR-CERT PKI Certificate Authority and Card Management System
The QR-CERT software is a specialized package of applications dedicated for the development of a Public Key Infrastructure system as well as the cards personalization and management system. The software contains a number of functional modules, enabling a flexible selection of functionalities for implementation. The software is dedicated for large organizations and corporate environments, with a PKI infrastructure and microprocessor cards. The QR-CERT is a solution both for the companies which plan to build their own PKI infrastructure and entities planning to provide services in this respect. This software enables the implementation of advanced security mechanisms, such as: secure e-mail (S/MIME), electronic signature (PKCS#7, XAdES), network transmission protection (IPSEC, SSL/TLS) and strong authentication for service portals (HTTPS) or strong authentication of users for the Windows ActiveDirectory domain.
